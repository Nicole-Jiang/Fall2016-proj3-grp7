Evaluation: not about prediction accuracy, but reproducibility

Baseline model - SIFt descriptors as features
Suggested model: gradient boosting machine GBM  w/ decision stumps as classifier

Task 1: implement and tune it correctly

nested strategy
- add new features (SIFT)
- new classifier/models/method (GBM)
compare both directions rather than diagonally

* it's mobile app, so running cannot take long and too much computation

Submission: Github repo
feature.R
train.R
test.R


Starter code: main.Rmd


* Training take days is fine. Processing features and prediction should be fast.


Evaluation:
- presentaion 40%
- reproducibility based on new images 60%

Image processing:

low-pass filtering: detect foreground color
high-pass: detect edges 
median filter: remove noise while keeping the edges
Adaptive thresholding
Contouring: outline analysis, then can calculate local curvature
Package 'Momocs': shape analysis, with link at the bottom

Color features: *resize pictures to be same size or normalize histograms, to compare 


---
SIFT:
rescale using Gaussian, subtract to get Difference of Gaussian (DoG), get the max/min points as keypoints
filter keypoints: discard those below threshold
Orientation: direction that color changes most, PCA actually
don't worry if don't understand theory
Packages have already provided functions

SIFT can only do gray scale
Other methods better than SIFT

descriptors are features
A 16x16 neighbourhood around the keypoint is taken. It is devided into 16 sub-blocks of 4x4 size. For each sub-block, 8 bin orientation histogram is created. So a total of 128 bin values are available.


Bagâ€”of-Words (BoW) model:
derived from NPL
visual words, prepare a vocabulary book (formed by k-means clustering)


Pipeline:
flowchart
give us SIFT feature histograms rather than us developing them

'GBM' package available
'xgboost' less flexible
