Modus Operandi of Feature Extraction Algorithm:

1. Take in every image
2. Extract the R,G,B colors of every image
3. Map every every Red, Blue or Green color to the nearest color
4. Create a frequency map of color combination of each pixel
5. We have have ensured our frequency count doesn't exceed 800
6. The count for every combination thus obtained are our features
7. Normalize features for every image
